# Yamabot



This is just here to be able to share the code, and there's also a whole website that's not open source yet cause I've still gotta figure out how to do that safely.

But hey, the irc module is pretty good I'd say, and the website isn't required for most of the functions in this bot. Just the song requests stuff. 

But you could even implement that locally and have it be a standalone bot. That'd be doable too.
